# KlausBot
A nifty little GroupMe bot.

Make sure you set your BOT_ID environment variable to a valid [GroupMe bot ID](https://dev.groupme.com/bots) to test.
Also set WOLFRAM_KEY to a Wolfram API key if you want the !push command to work.  You don't have to set WOLFRAM_KEY in order to test the bot, however.  same goes for the Dark Sky API.

Example command implementation:
