# Klaus
An extensible platform agnostic automation service.

Originally a novelty bot, Klaus has transcended GroupMe to become a fully extensible automation tool. In addition to command-based invocations, you can create automation using the [ChatComponent](src/chat-component.js) api.

For an example 'bot' service implementation, see [Klaus's Slack persona](klausbot/src/bots/slack.js).

Example command implementation:
